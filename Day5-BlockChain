Write a blog explaining the features of the Ethereum BlockChain and how it is different from Bitcoin.

Ethereum is a blockchain project with a cryptocurrency(Ether). One of the most paramount features is "smart contracts". As the name says 
is a contract for people around the world even if we live in difference countries.We can programming this contractwith a programming
language:Serpent or Solidity. 
Ethereum "Gas" is  a unit that measures the amount of computational effort it will take to execute certain operations. Every operation that
takes part in Ethereum(smart contract or transaction) requires some amount of gas. Every Mines get paid an amount in Ether which is 
equivalentto the total amount of gas it took to execute a operation. The operation consists in validate new transactions and record them,
it took 10 minutesto mine a block. Finally, Miners compete to solve a difficul mathematical problem based or cryptographic hash algorithm.
 
Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most valuable crytocurrencies but their no the same. First, Ethereum has added a complete virtual machine
language and processing capability embedded. Ethereum is capable of storing computer code applications that can use the CPU power going
into the network to execute. If we talk about speed of transcations, Etherum is the one, their transcations typically settling in seconds.
Bitcoin is limted to 1MB in size, on the other hand, in Ethereum, blocks are capped by the gas-limit. In Bitcoin, they use money. 

In concluse, we can say that Bitcoin is like a digital money and Ethereum, smart contracts. Both are decentralized.
