How to explain your granny about ML:
Machine Learning is like a newborn child without knowledge and it cannot talk yet. Since days go on, he start learning a few things like saying “mom” or “dad”. That ability of learning is machine learning. He accepts everything you teach him, even if it is wrong, but not for too long.
Now that he goes to school, his knowledge will start increase with math, theory etc. This knowledge is a supervised learn because the child is learning now with a teacher.  When He get home, he must do his homework by his own; he must association his knowledge from the school to solve problems.  At the moment, he received his homework from the teacher, he will know with problems was correct o incorrect. 
With this new experience, he will understand that it he get wrong will failed the exam, on the other hand, if he get good marks, he will have an award.
Finally, let us change the child for a robot, the robot will have the capability to learn and solve problems. Machine learning can detect spam email or can recognize your face in a photo on Facebook, just as a child would do it.
